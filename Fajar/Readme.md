Fajar's Work

Instructions : 

1. [Getting the Dataset] Download the data from this link https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-depot-product-search-relevance/data

2. [Pre-processing and Feature Engineering] run functions.ipynb to pre-process the data and create features. This will create file ready.csv which contains features (credit : David Agababyan)

3. [Predictions] Run any of the .ipynb files which contains model names. I implemented three models, OLS Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost. Each of those files will generate three files, optimization_[model_name].csv contains the parameter tuning result, CV_[model name].csv contains metric performance result, and submission_[model_name].csv which is a Kaggle submission file   

4. [Extra - Plotting result] run plot_result.ipynb to plot the metrics
